ReactiveNode should be an organism that subscribes to mouse position.

Inside ReactiveNode is the content which should be a molecule or an atom

pass in a "calculatePosition" prop based off it's index and the current mouse position

eased interpolation from last to new position


ReactiveGrid is the container component.  calculatePosition is defined here and its reference is defined via useCallback which depends on spacing, size, etc


how to handle transition to detail view?

how to handle reactive loading (cascading fade in / scale / reposition effect)

typing into filter causes matching emoji to highlight and nonmatching ones to fade slightly, then a couple seconds later the ReactiveGrid reconfigures to display only the new match criteria


To "shrink" the grid when filtering, a node's new position should become the closest unoccupied position to the 'center' of the grid.  Note that the center is not necessarily (0,0)

Come up with a function that transforms a 1D index into 2D indices (x,y) based on a spiral about the origin.

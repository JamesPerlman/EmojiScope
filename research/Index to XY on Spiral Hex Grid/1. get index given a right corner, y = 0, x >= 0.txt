TL;DR

for the "right corner" of each point in the spiral hexagon
where y = 0 and x > 0, the index can be found using this very nice formula:

f(n) gives us the index at ring n

f(n) = n + 3 * n * (n + 1) 

----
let's look at the corners, starting with the ones on the pos x-axis

points along the positive x-axis (y=0, x >= 0) follow a formula.

index : point (n, 0) -> n means the nth hexagonal ring  
0     : (0, 0)
1     : (1, 0) +1  = 0 * 6 + 1 
8     : (2, 0) +7  = 1 * 6 + 1
21    : (3, 0) +13 = 2 * 6 + 1
40    : (4, 0) +19 = 3 * 6 + 1
65    : (5, 0) +25
96    : (6, 0) +31
133   : (7, 0) +37

i     : (n, 0)

x = n, nth ring

let f(n) = i be a function where n is x such that x > 0 and the ring starts at (n, 0)
for now let's define f(0) = 0

looks like:
f(n + 1) = f(n) + n * 6 + 1
f(n) = f(n - 1) + (n - 1) * 6 + 1

f(0) = 0
0 = 0
f(1) = f(0) + 0 * 6 + 1  :  1 = 0 + 0 * 6 + 1
1 = 1 + 0
f(2) = f(1) + 1 * 6 + 1  :  8 = 1 + 1 * 6 + 1 = (0) + (0 * 6 + 1) + (1 * 6 + 1) 
8 = 2 + 6
f(3) = f(2) + 2 * 6 + 1  : 21 = 8 + 2 * 6 + 1 = (0) + (0 * 6 + 1) + (1 * 6 + 1) + (2 * 6 + 1)
21 = 3 + 6 * (1 + 2)
f(4) = f(2) + 3 * 6 + 1  : 40 = 21 + 3 * 6 + 1 = (0) + (0 * 6 + 1) + (1 * 6 + 1) + (2 * 6 + 1) + (3 * 6 + 1)
40 = 0 + (0 * 6) + 1 + (1 * 6) + 1 + (2 * 6) + 1 + (3 * 6) + 1
40 = 4 + (1 * 6) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 6)
40 = 4 + 6 * (1 + 2 + 3)
40 = 4 + 6 * s(3) = 4 + 6 * (1 / 2) * 3 * (3 + 1) -> yep.
etc

f(n) = n + 6 * (1 / 2) * n * (n + 1)

f(n) = n + 3 * n * (n + 1) 
BOOM.

summation: s(x) = âˆ‘x from 1 to n = (1 / 2) * n * (n + 1)
s(5) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15 = (1 / 2) * 5 * (5 + 1) = 15

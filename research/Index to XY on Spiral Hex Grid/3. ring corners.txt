Building off our previous work, we can get the index of a ring given the index of a node.

We also have some functions to traverse the hexagonal grid in any straight direction over any arbitrary distance

Now, given an arbitrary ring, let's get the sub-index of all 6 corners of the hexagon.
Note that the last sub-index is not really a corner, it preceeds the first corner of the next ring.  So we don't count it in our calculations.

We also have the sequence of steps it takes to complete a ring spiral given the index:

the traverseGrid(startPoint, numSteps, direction) function returns a new point which is the result of
traversing the hexagonal grid starting from `startPoint`, taking `numSteps` steps in the defined `direction`

For ring n the start point is always (n, 0)
Also for directions like right, left, top, bottom, we assume +x is right and +y is up
For the directions, N means negative and P means positive.  There are 6 possible directions in which one can move to an adjacent point:

NX: negative-x
PX: positive-x
NXNY: negative-x, negative-y
NXPY: negative-x, positive-y
PXNY: positive-x, negative-y
PXPY: positive-x, positive-y

Here's how we walk in a spiral.

But first, a little diagram of points, in this example a period is an in-between node, and p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5 are corner points.

This actually represents ring 2 if you're counting the nodes.

+y
^
|      p2 . p1
|     .       .
|    p3       p0
|     .         .
|      p4 . . p5
|
 -----------------> +x

// for ring n:
// starting point is always (n, 0)
p0 = (n, 0);

// walk NXPY from p0 n times
p1 = traverseGrid(p0, n, NXPY)

// walk NX from p1 n times
p2 = traverseGrid(p1, n, NX)

// walk NXNY from p2 n times
p3 = traverseGrid(p2, n, NXNY)

// walk PXNY from p3 n times
p4 = traverseGrid(p3, n, PXNY)

// walk PX from p4 (n + 1) times
p5 = traverseGrid(p4, n + 1, PX)


/// ^^^ THIS IS ITERATIVE.  WE CAN DO BETTER!

I just realized there's an easier way that doesn't rely on calculating the previous n points to get to corner point pn.

// array of directions to take from center in order to generate point at index i of this array
CD = [PX, PXPY, NXPY, NX, NXNY, PXNY]

o = (0,0); // origin
p0 = traverseGrid(o, n, CD[0])
p1 = traverseGrid(o, n, CD[1])
p2 = traverseGrid(o, n, CD[2])
p3 = traverseGrid(o, n, CD[3])
p4 = traverseGrid(o, n, CD[4])
p5 = traverseGrid(o, n, CD[5]) + (1, 0) // p5 is a special case because it's an extra space over, always.

SO, given an arbitrary index i, we can calculate the ring index n and all of its corner points (p0 - p5).
We can also calculate the subindex of i in ring n, let's call that `si`

We also can easily define the subindices of each corner point.  Let's do that.

s0 = 0
s1 = n
s2 = 2n
s3 = 3n
s4 = 4n
p5 = 5n + 1

Here's the algorithm I'm thinking of:

We find the two corner points surrounding the subindex si, let's call them (pa, sa) for (point a, subindex of point a) and (pb, sb).

Then we find the direction D needed to traverse along the line from pa to pb.

Then we say pi (point for index i) is equal to traverseGrid(pa, sa - si, D).

And voilÃ¡! We now have a function indexToXY(i) -> (x, y) that takes in an index and outputs the x and y with relatively low complexity!

Extremely low complexity compared to counting all the previous nodes before the node at index i.

how to find the closest corner point index to subindex in question:

given: i = index of node (x,y) we want to find.

// I(i) gives us the index of the ring that node i is within
// R(n) gives us the number of nodes in all rings including ring n
// N(n) gives us the number of nodes in only ring n
N(n) = 6n + 1
N(n) = R(n) - R(n - 1)

// IP(n, si) gives us the closest corner point to subindex si in ring n
IP(n, si) {
  if (si < 5 * n + 1) {
    return min(4, floor(si / n))
  } else {
    return 5;
  }
}

// SP(n, ip) gives us the subindex of the corner point at index ip (0 - 5)
SP(n, ip) {
  if (ip === 5) {
    return 5 * n + 1;
  } else {
    return ip * n;
  }
}


// ^ both of these functions are from the previous file "2. get ring by index.txt"

// array of dirs between each corner point
PD = [NXPY,NX,NXNY,PXNY,PX];

function indexToXY(i) {
  // get n (index of ring that node i is within)
  n = I(i)

  // si is subindex of i in ring n
  si = i - R(n - 1)

  // ip is corner point index of closest corner point
  ip = IP(n, si);

  // sp is subindex of that corner point
  sp = SP(n, ip)

  // calculate p_sp ( corner point at index sp )
  p_sp = ...instructions to calc this point above

  return traverseGrid(p_sp, si - sp, PD[ip])


  // done!!!
}

excellent job we did it :)

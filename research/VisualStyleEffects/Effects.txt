ItemStyleEffect?
GridItemEffect?

Not sure what to call these, 

let's say the base interface is called
ItemStyleEffect

interface ItemStyleEffect {
  getStyle(itemPosition: Point2D, effectPosition: Point2D)
}

All ItemStyleEffects share this interface however their constructors or factory methods may be very different.

It might be a good optimization to curry the getStyle function, but maybe not.  It might be an unnecessary or counterproductive micro-optimization.

Anyway let's define a few effects.

---------

MagnificationEffect

This one produces a scale & translate style that magnifies and displaces GridItems.  we already have all the code to make this happen.

---------

EdgeFadeEffect

This one fades out objects that get close to the window's edge.
